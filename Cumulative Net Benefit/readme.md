# Supply Chain Automation Investment Screening: Cumulative Net Benefit Analysis

## 1. Project Background & Business Problem
**Context:**
The company is evaluating 4 options for supply chain automation to improve operational efficiency. 

**The Challenge:**
Traditional investment screening often relies heavily on **initial CapEex** and **Payback Period**. However, this approach can be short-sighted. 
We needed a more holistic view to evaluate which option drives the best **long-term growth** and sustainable value for the company.

## 2. Methodology
To solve this, I developed a **Cumulative Net Benefit Analysis** model based on our ROI framework. 
* **Goal:** To visualize the net value creation over a 4-year horizon (2026-2029).
* **Metrics:** CapEex against projected cumulative net benefits.
* **Scenarios:** Evaluated 4 distinct investment options (Option A, B, C, and D).

## 3. Key Insights & Analysis
The analysis revealed a critical trade-off between upfront affordability and long-term profitability.

### Comparative Analysis: Option B vs. Option D
As shown in the chart above:

* **Low Barrier to Entry (Option B):** Option B requires the lowest initial investment (CapEx **€0.73 M**). It represents a "safe" short-term choice with minimal financial risk.
    
* **Long-Term Value Driver (Option D):** Option D requires a significantly higher upfront investment (CapEx **€2.76 M**, approx. 3.8x of Option B). 
    
* **The Turning Point:**
    Despite the higher initial cost, **Option D** demonstrates superior performance over time. The trend line (green) shows that Option D accelerates value creation, eventually generating the highest **Cumulative Net Benefit (~€40.0 M)** by 2029, significantly outperforming Option B.

## 4. Recommendation
Based on this analysis, I recommend pursuing **Option D**. 

While Option B offers immediate cost savings, **Option D is the superior strategic choice** for the company's long-term development. The incremental CapEx is justified by the substantial increase in net benefit over the 4-year period.
